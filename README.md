# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

In this project we have five images, and on each image there is something different is written. When user click on the image an random image shows up and this thing continues infinite time.

To achive this random image every time user clicks we had used an in-built library name as "dart:math", this library is responsilbe for generating random outcomes from the given set of outcomes.

You can learrn more about this "dart:math" library from the official documentation provided by the flutter team from https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-math/dart-math-library.html
